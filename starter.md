A format for a Model can contain several kind of information.

- an interface on which the model can talk to the rest of the world (other models). This are typicall the IOs.
- each interface can have more attributes. Example can be direction, type, width, etc..
- a scalable format should be defined in order to describe the model. Such format should ideally have the following:
    - machine readable
    - human readable
    - extensible and scalable with time
    - capable of describing somehow multi-dimensional data
    - off-the shelv parsere shoudl be able to just read the format correctly. possible formats (CSV, XML, Jason, Yaml)

- etc.. etc...
